     <p>This postcard project was designed to be for any place, real or imaginary. 
         Starting from the project brief, I had no place in mind. 
         I then took the action of creating this postcard for no place at all. 
         The purpose of this postcard is to convey complete randomness and nonsense for a place that does not exist. 
         However, I wanted to convey a message of how creativity and how oneâ€™s potential has no ceiling. 
         Rather, it reaches past the stars.

         At the start of this process, I was inspired by old vintage ads about anything. 
         I placed an old vintage ad of the Grand Canyon , an ad for a boat as well as an ad for a refridgerator. 
         I then added components of space as well as greek mythology, as I have a deep liking for it. 
         I then formatted this postcard cover to portray randomness, however display a cohesive layout for the audience to understand.

         This project stemmed from the love I have for New York and my home country of the Philippines. 
         I took a side street view of Manhattan and implemented aspects of what you would see on the side street of the Philippines. 
         This project made me begin to use different tools like the sponge and burner tool to make sure the components from the Philippine matches the landscape of the New York street.

         For this project, it was created rigth after I came from vacation fromt the Philippines. 
         I wanted to create a concept of my homeland to the place I grew up in. 
         I took concepts from the Philippines like the Jeepney , a side store and a vintage Jollibee poster (the staple of the Philippines). 
         These components would be mixed alongside the New York City side street view.
