    <h3>Description</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This postcard project was designed just from curiosity.
        I've always wanted to know how I would perform designing an app.
        I present to you, Anther. An app for avid plant lovers, ranging from any category that they please.
        On this app, shoppers are able to shop the  globe for their desired plants.

    <p>
        The idea came about from the recent liking into plants.
        Something I little to no knowledge on, I decided why not.
        I used Figma software to from the elements withing this layout design.
        I wanted to create the look to be appealing towards the latest generation , the simple yet clean and cut design for shoppers to navigate through.
