                The logo was created through Adobe Illustrator. I wanted to create a logo of two opposite terms.
                I was able to branch out with calm and rough. Thus, the counterintuitive name of Serene Fitness.
                I searched up calming aspects like pine trees and meditation, I took references adn used the pen tool to depict each image.
